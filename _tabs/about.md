Hello, this is my personal blog section. ðŸ‘‹

The creation of my personal site stemmed from a realization during my job hunt â€“ having a personal website could be a game-changer. So, I created my [personal portfolio site](https://chriszbga.netlify.app/) earlier this year, 2024.

As I look into profolio templates and personal websites I noticed that most them come with a blog section. That got me thinking â€“ why not leverage this opportunity to not only complete my personal site but also refine my writing skills? Of course, I won't shy away from using AI tools to iron out any pesky grammar or spelling mistakes. ðŸ˜… And voila, here we are â€“ a blog page on my site.

This blog is more of a personal endeavor, a space for me to **document my experiences**, **share cybersecurity insights**, or simply **engage in some freewriting**. It's a journey of self-reflection, both personally and professionally.

Note: Most of my posts is gonna be edited by AI tools. ðŸ˜†

Thank you for visiting!
